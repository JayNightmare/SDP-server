# SDP Server

A JavaScript-based server application designed to [describe the purpose of the project briefly].

## Features

1. **MongoDB Integration**:
   - The server requires a MongoDB URI (`DB_URI`) and database name (`DB_NAME`), indicating it supports database operations.

2. **Configurable Server Port**:
   - You can configure the server's port using the `PORT` variable.

3. **JWT Authentication**:
   - The presence of `JWT_SECRET` suggests features related to user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
